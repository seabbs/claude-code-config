Implement statistical model from specification: $ARGUMENTS

1. Define scope: inputs, outputs, integration points with existing code
2. Review research context, existing codebase patterns, and CLAUDE.md standards
3. Translate mathematical formulations into code with clear variable naming
4. Follow language-specific best practices (type stability in Julia, vectorisation in R)
5. Add documentation in the appropriate format (roxygen2, docstrings)
6. Write tests focused on parameter recovery from simulated data
7. Verify integration with existing code and run tests
